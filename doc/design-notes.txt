Need to restructure current prototype... 

Remove ExternalResource/TextContent/BinaryContent/Page elements and replace with a single 
Resource tag that has attributes which define wether or not it's embedded/external
and which specifies the content encoding as defined in urn:ietf:rfc:1521.5 
(http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1521/5.htm).

Basically, the Resource tag will conform to the RFC1521 spec for mime content streams 
using attributes for the content header fields... plus some extra gravy for opsed domain 
specific stuff.

Also need a concept of case/custodian somewhere in here. Currently custodian is just a 
text string attribute on ESI... Which might be enough, if it's speced to contian a URN. 

Then we'd need to define a urn schema for cases and custodians... 
urn:opsed:case:5aa2e794-a16e-4fd8-b4c1-8cc2a920ff4e
urn:opsed:custodian:8857217a-1090-4f09-a7c4-784cc2b88072

and a server that can return some case/custodian schema data...
and a schema for the data... ;)

for now, we'll just say it's a URN, and leave the definiation of the rest of it up until later. 
What's important is that it's a unique identifier, which is provisioned by requiring URN.

Resource Tag:

Attributes:
 * content-type
   * required
   * indicates the mime type  of the resource
 * content-transfer-encoding
    * required
    * possible values: "7bit", "8bit", "quoted-printable", "base64", "binary", "uri", "uri-relative"
    * indicates the specific content-transfer-encoding of the enclosed tag data. 
 * native
   * optional
   * indicates that the resource is the native document, as opposed to some other representation/conversion
 * unit
   * required for all instances
   * possible values are "document" or "unit"
   * describes wether this resource is a document level or page level resource
 * controlIDStart
   * required for all instances
   * when unit value is "document", indicates beginning of control id range for resource.
   * when unit value is "page", indicates control id for resource.
 * controlIDEnd
   * required only when unit value is "document"
   * indicates end of control id range for resource.
 * oridinal 
   * required only when unit value is "page"
   * indicates the page ordinal for the specific page level resource within the document scope

There will be an attribute "native" which is a boolean value that defaults to false.
There will be an attribute "unit" which specifies the unit of measure for the content...  
Possible values for unit are "page" and "document". 

If unit is "document" then the resource tag should also contain the attributes "controlIDStart" and "controlIDEnd", but not "controlIDEnd".
If unit is "page" then the resource tag should also contain the attributes "ordinal" and "controlIDStart", but not "controlIDEnd".

content-transfer-encoding attribute: 
possible values: "7bit", "8bit", "quoted-printable", "base64", "binary", "uri", "uri-relative"

The values "7bit", "8bit", "quoted-printable", "base64", "binary" have exactly the same meaning as they 
do in urn:ietf:rfc:1521.5, with the addition that they will be escaped to work correctly in XML or embedded
in a CDATA element (not preferred).  

The values "uri" and "uri-relative" are unique to the opsed format and are used for linking in external resources.
For "uri", the contents of the tag will be a fully pathed URI to the external resource
For "uri-relative" the contents will be a relative path (from whatever the current context is). 

EG:

linked resources:
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="uri" content-type="application/ms-word" isNative="true" unit="document" controlIDStart="BAT00001" controlIDEnd="BAT00002">edap://myserver.com/000/BAT0001.doc</Resource>
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="uri-relative" content-type="application/ms-word" isNative="true" unit="document" controlIDStart="BAT00001" controlIDEnd="BAT00002">/000/BAT0001.doc</Resource>
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="uri-relative" content-type="text/plain" unit="page" ordinal="1" controlIDStart="BAT00001">/000/BAT0001.doc/pages/BAT0001.txt</Resource>
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="uri-relative" content-type="image/tiff" unit="page" ordinal="2" controlIDStart="BAT00002">/000/BAT0001.doc/pages/BAT0002.tif</Resource>
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="uri-relative" content-type="text/plain" unit="document" controlIDStart="BAT00001" controlIDEnd="BAT00002">/000/BAT0001.doc/full-text/BAT0001.txt</Resource>

Embedded resources:
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="8bit" content-type="text/plain" unit="document" controlIDStart="BAT00001" controlIDEnd="BAT00002">This is the full text of the BAT00001.doc. Of course, it's XML escaped, so that &lt; doesn't break our transfer format .</Resource>
<Resource content-transfer-encoding="base64" content-type="text/plain" unit="document" controlIDStart="BAT00001" controlIDEnd="BAT00002">VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgZnVsbCB0ZXh0IG9mIHRoZSBCQVQwMDAwMS5kb2MuDCBPZiBjb3Vyc2UsIGl0J3MgWE1MIGVzY2FwZWQsIHNvIHRoYXQgJmx0OyBkb2Vzbid0IGJyZWFrIG91ciB0cmFuc2ZlciBmb3JtYXQgLg==</Resource>
