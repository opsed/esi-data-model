The OpSED ESI Data Access Protocol is a system for allowing the interchange of the electronically stored information (ESI) handled by eDiscovery technology.
The OpSED ESI Data Model is a description of the entities, constraints, and relationships of the electronically stored information (ESI) handled by eDiscovery technology.

The purpose of defining this data access protocol is to facilitate the creation of standardized software server protocols for handling ESI. An example use would be to create a data server layer on top of a proprietary data store which enables cross-technology interchange of the ESI stored in that system.
The purpose of defining this data model is to facilitate the creation of standardized software data structures for handling ESI. An example use would be to create a XSD description that describes this data model. From the XSD, developers may generate source code for various programming languages to implement this model within software technologies, or simply use the XML schema to create and validate XML data files for cross-technology interchange of ESI.
